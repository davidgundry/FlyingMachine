# FlyingMachine
A game for the Great Steampunk Game Jam, York, 2016

Recover an inventor's bizarre inventions by taking to the sky in his new flying machine - powered by speech! His patented Phono-Motor to convert speech into motion. The more ridiculus the phrases you say, the more thrust it generates!
